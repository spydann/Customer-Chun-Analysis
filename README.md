# Customer-Chun-Analysis
Welcome to our customer churn rate analysis project! In this repository, we explore the phenomenon of customer churn within our business. Customer churn, or customer attrition, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company over a specific period. Understanding and mitigating customer churn is crucial for the sustained growth and success of any business.


In this analysis, we aim to:

* Identify Patterns: We will analyze historical customer data to identify patterns and trends that may indicate potential churn behavior.
* Factors Impacting Churn: We will investigate various factors that may impact customer churn, such as demographics, purchasing behavior, customer service interactions, and more.
* Recommendations: Based on our findings, we will provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

Repository Structure
data: This directory contains the datasets used in the analysis.
pbix file : contains the power bi file which contains the dashboard 
dashboard pdf file: a pdf file contains a static image of the dashboard 
README.md: This document provides an overview of the project.

The dataset was gotten from a telecommunication company and contains 6687 customer records and 19 categories(columns). 
A bit of data cleaning was done on the data using power bi (power query) such as:
* Seperating columns headers from rows
* Formatting each records to the appropriate format
The data was further worked on by using DAX to create calculated columns and appropraite measure to convey meaningful insights about the churn rate.

# Analysis Summary 
* Overall Churn Rate: The average churn rate across all cities is approximately 26.97%.

* Age Trends: Analysis of churn across different age groups indicates a significant churn rate among customers aged 29.

* Top Reasons for Churn: The top three reasons cited by customers for leaving are:
    * Competitor offering better deals,
    * Attitude of support personnel, and
    * Attitude of service providers.
    * Unspecified Reasons: The majority of churn cases did not specify a reason for leaving. Among those who did, the most common reasons were better offers from competitors and superior 
        devices offered by competitors.

* Geographical Impact: The city with the highest churn rate, West Virginia, experienced churn primarily due to better offers from competitors and superior devices offered elsewhere.

* Age Demographics: Churn customers tend to be predominantly above 30 years of age.

* Contract Type: Churn customers are mostly on month-to-month contract plans.



Based on the analysis results, here are some recommendations to address customer churn:

* Competitive Pricing and Offers: Develop competitive pricing strategies and promotional offers to match or surpass those of competitors. This could involve introducing special discounts, loyalty rewards, or bundled services to incentivize customers to stay.
* Enhance Customer Support: Focus on improving the attitude and responsiveness of support personnel. Providing thorough training and emphasizing the importance of positive customer interactions can help enhance the overall customer experience.
* Service Provider Attitude: Similarly, address any issues related to the attitude and behavior of service providers. Encourage a customer-centric approach among service staff and implement feedback mechanisms to monitor and improve service quality.
* Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Leverage customer demographic insights to tailor marketing campaigns specifically towards age groups that exhibit higher churn rates, such as those aged 29 and above. Personalized messaging and offers may resonate better with these segments.
* Customer Feedback Mechanisms: Implement robust mechanisms for collecting and analyzing customer feedback. This could include regular surveys, customer satisfaction ratings, and feedback forms to identify areas for improvement and address customer concerns promptly.
* Retention Incentives: Introduce retention incentives for customers on month-to-month contract plans. This could involve offering discounts or additional benefits for customers who commit to longer-term contracts, thereby encouraging greater loyalty and reducing churn.
* Product and Service Improvement: Continuously assess and enhance the quality and features of products and services offered. Stay abreast of industry trends and technological advancements to ensure offerings remain competitive and meet evolving customer needs.
* Localized Strategies: Tailor strategies and promotions to address specific churn drivers in different geographic regions. For example, in areas with high competition, focus on highlighting unique value propositions or offering localized deals to retain customers.
